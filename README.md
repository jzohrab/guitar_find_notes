# Find note

The silliest possible "game" to help learn notes on the guitar neck.

## What it does

After you set the parameters, the program:

* plays a "click" to get your attention
* shows a note name
* pauses a specified time
* plays the tone corresponding to the note
* pauses a specified time
* goes back to step 1, showing the next random note

## Why this might be useful:

You're learning a lick, and want to be able to play it in various
keys, or shift to the right spot at the drop of a hat.

You know the E and A string well, but need to be able to find the
related notes on other strings quickly.  For example, you might be
thinking of drop 2 chords, where the root is on the D string ... you
need to find the root quickly, and build the chord around that.

You don't want to use "reference notes" or "positions" to find things,
you're trying to learn things cold.

## Usage

* select the notes you want to find, or the key you'll play in.
* enter the repeat count, the various times.
* hit start.
